# eggcounter
A custom built aplication and server for keeping accountability on my family business

this project aims to provide:
- a client list,
- a transaction list
- transactions associated to a client
- aliases to refer to clients with different names
- client balance, transactions balance
- a server to hold the database and stuff
- android client that connects to the server

this project has some very specific needs as stated above, more flexibility may be added on the future once the server is finished.
